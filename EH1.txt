AIM : 
Use Google and Whois for Reconnaisasance.
Description:
What is Reconnaissance?
Ethical hacking begins with gathering information and becoming familiar with the target system. 
Reconnaissance refers to a set of processes and techniques, such as footprinting and scanning and enumeration, 
that are used to gather and covertly discover as much information as possible about a target system.

Reconnaissance is an essential step in locating and stealing confidential information. In a proper recon, 
attackers would have access to detailed information. In this way, reconnaissance, in information security, 
is used for penetration testing.

To gain information without actively engaging with the network, an attacker uses recon to interact with the network’s open 
ports, running services, etc. The information it provides can help gain access to networks beyond the internet. In short, 
recon is a treasure trove of valuable information that is susceptible to attacks.
Reconnaissance : collecting a inform about particular portal or website, so using below tool or Portal 
we will gather information about website or particular portal
1) Whois
2) Shodan.io

AIM : 
2.1) Use CryptTool to encrypt and decrypt passwords using RC4 algorithm. 
RC4 (also known as Rivest Cipher 4) is a form of stream cipher. It encrypts messages one byte at a time via an algorithm. 
Plenty of stream ciphers exist, but RC4 is among the most popular. 
It's simple to apply, and it works quickly, even on very large pieces of data.
STEPS:
Step 2: Enter a plaintext 
Step 4: Using RC4 Decryption
2.2) Use Cain and Abel for cracking Windows account password using Dictionary attack and to decode wireless network passwords 
RESULT:
OPEN CAIN AND ABEL
Go to Tools
Click on HASH Calculator
Type password
Then Calculate
copy the MD5 HASH CODE
Go to Cracker Select MD5 
Click on + PASTE the HASH Code
Right Click on the hash code select DICTIONARY ATTACK
Right Click Add the Wordlist CLICK START
you will get password Under PASSWORD

 2.1) Use CryptTool to encrypt and decrypt passwords using RC4 algorithm.

AIM : 
3.1) Using TraceRoute, ping, ifconfig, netstat Command . 
3.2) Perform ARP Poisoning in Windows . 

3.1) Using TraceRoute, ping, ifconfig, netstat Command .
TRACERT:
The traceroute command is a useful and easy-to-run network diagnostic tool. 
Typically, it is the first way to troubleshoot a connection issue. 
The command might differ depending on your operating system – Linux and macOS use traceroute, while Windows utilizes tracert.

PING Command in Linux with examples. PING (Packet Internet Groper) 
command is used to check the network connectivity between host and server/host

IPCONFIG Full Form. IPCONFIG stands for Internet Protocol Configuration. 
This is a command-line application which displays all the current TCP/IP

NETSTAT:
Show active and inactive connections.
****************************************************************************
CODE:
OUTPUT:
Step 1: 
Open cmd & type tracert command and type www.siesascs.edu.in press “Enter”. 
After that type ping ,ipconfig and netstat command respectively
TRACEROUTE:
PING:,IPCONFIG:,NETSTAT

3.2) Perform ARP Poisoning in Windows . 
Step 1 : Open Cain and abel tool
ARP POSINING
Go to Win7
Open Windows powershell type command "netsh int ip set global taskoffload=disable"
then open network connections
Right click the local connection
go to properties uncheck the IPv6
double click IPv4 go to advance<DNS<check the USE THIS CONNECTION DNS last option click ok
Open Cian Able>start/stop sniffer
go to sniffer click + click ok
Click ARP at bottom>click + select Address on both side>click ok
Then start the ARP beside START/STOP sniffer

AIM : Using Nmap scanner to perform port scanning of various forms – ACK, SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS. 
●	NOTE: Install Nmap for windows and install it. After that open cmd and type “nmap” to check if 
it is installed properly. Now type the below commands. 

ACK:
The TCP ACK scan is used to check if a system is protected by a firewall or not. If no RST 
response is given from the target system, Nmap assumes that the target system is filtered.
SYN:
This scan is called the SYN stealth scan, which means the nmap will scan the target without 
actually creating the TCP connection and analysing the response from a server to estimate the port’s status. 
The scan performed by nmap in stealth mode is pretty faster as compared to the TCP connect scan.
FIN"
Nmap initiates a FIN scan by using a FIN packet. 
Since there is no earlier communication between the scanning host and the target host, the target responds with an 
RST packet to reset the connection. However, by doing so, it reveals its presence. 
A FIN scan is initiated using a command like nmap -sF 192.168.100.100.
NULL Scan (-sN):
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)

Nmap Xmas:
Nmap Xmas scan was considered a stealthy scan which analyzes responses to Xmas packets to determine the 
nature of the replying device.

CODE:
1.
●	ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan) 
It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, 
determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered. 
 
Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org 
●	SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS) 
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It can be performed quickly, 
scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive firewalls. 
 
Command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org 

●	FIN Scan (-sF)  
Sets just the TCP FIN bit. 
 
Command: nmap -sF -T4 para 
nmap -sF 192.168.100.100
●	NULL Scan (-sN) 
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0) 
 
Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org 
●	XMAS Scan (-sX) 
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree. 
 
Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org

AIM:Simulate persistant Cross Site Scripting attack. 
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and 
trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form 
of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur 
anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know 
that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, 
the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used 
with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS flaws

<?php
    if(isset($_GET['login']))
    {
        echo "Enterd by you:<br>";
